What is considered a part of NLU?

Slot tagger (Chosen)
State tracker
Intent classifier  (Chosen)

================================
What metrics do we use for NLU evaluation?

Task success rate
Number of turns in the dialog 
Slots F1 (chosen)
Intent accuracy (chosen)

===============================
Choose correct statements about NLU.

You can use Convolutional Networks for slot tagging. (chosen)
You can use 1D convolutions for intent classification. (chosen)
Training a joint NLU model helps intent classifier and slot tagger. (chosen)
Joint NLU model can't produce predictions faster than two separate models combined (one for intent classification and another for slot tagging)

================================

Choose correct statements about dialog context.

We can use memory networks to deal with context. (chosen)

We need dialog context in single-turn dialogs.

We can add a simple feature like "previous utterance intent" as a categorical feature to NLU to start taking into account the context of the dialog.(chosen)

==================================
Let me remind you the BIOES lexicon encoding algorithm:

Suppose you have a lexicon of 3 places:

Los Angeles
San Francisco
San Francisco Airport
Let's encode the text "Los Francisco Airport".

What encoding will we have?
B I E(chosen)

B B E 

B E E

===================================
What is considered a part of a dialog state in DSTC 2 challenge?

Method  (chosen)
The intent of previous utterance
Requested slots (chosen)
Goals (chosen)
====================================
How Frames dataset was collected?

Computer-computer dialogs
Human-human dialogs (chosen)
Human-computer dialogs  

=================================
Choose correct statements about dialog policy.


We need some kind of NLG (at least with hand-crafted rules) to convert a system policy to a human readable utterance. (chosen)

We can't learn a dialog manager end-to-end. 

This is a mapping from a dialog state to a system action. (chosen)
