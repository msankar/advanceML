Find correct statements below.


"Interlingual" level of transfer provides the best accuracy in statistical machine translation systems.

Evaluation in Machine Translation is hard, mostly because of many variations in translations. (CORRECT)

Recent machine translation systems provide equally good quality for all language pairs.

Neural Machine Translation is able to produce translations for language pairs that have never been observed in train. (CORRECT)

Machine Translation area was developing with gradual advances each year.

Compute BLEU score for the following example with 2 digits after decimal point:

System output: A friend when needed is a friend indeed.

Reference: A friend in need is a friend indeed.

Let us say we are building a translation system from Greek (g) to Bulgarian (b). Which of the following statements are correct?


We will need to build a translation model p(b|g)p(b∣g).


Language model here is complicated because different word alignments are possible.


The noisy channel concept here corresponds to conditional distribution p(g|b)p(g∣b). (CORRECT)


We will need to build language model p(b)p(b). (CORRECT)
============================================

Which parametrization for word alignment model would you use, if you know that sentences for your language pair often have aligned sequential chunks?

Notation: (e, f) - sentence pair, (I, J) - their lengths respectively, a - alignment.


Option 1: p(f, a|e) = p(J|e )\prod_{j=1}^J p(a_j) p(f_j | a_j, e)p(f,a∣e)=p(J∣e)∏
